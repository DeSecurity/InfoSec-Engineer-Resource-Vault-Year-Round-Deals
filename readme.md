# 🛡️ InfoSec Engineer Resource Vault & Year-Round Deals

> **Note:** This page is not a checklist of requirements to become an infosec engineer. I started this journey without formal certifications, driven by curiosity, hands-on practice, and a love for hacking and learning. This page is a curated list of tools, training, and services tailored to my path — practical, self-driven, and focused on deep skill development. It’s meant for security engineers who want to grow by doing — not just checking boxes.

- Track **year-round deals and discounts** for security tools, training, and vendors

## 🧠 Mindset and Philosophy
This vault is not about gatekeeping titles or collecting badges. It's about:
- Learning through **practice, failure, and iteration**
- Valuing **function over form** — the tools that make you better, not just look good on paper
- Curating **your own journey** through the noise

If it makes you a better hacker, a stronger defender, or a wiser engineer — it belongs here.
